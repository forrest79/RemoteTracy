# Tracy - RemoteBar (proof of concept)

## Sample app

To see all the features, there is simple sample Nette application. Run it with `run-sample-app` at port `8080`. You can see Tracy bar for all types (web page, redirects, AJAX, API, cli...).

Before running, just update correct server URL in `sample-app/config/local.neon`.
